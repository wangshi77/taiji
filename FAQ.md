# Frequently Asked Questions

### My favorite channel is not on the playlist.

Start by asking our community for help via [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/iptv-org/discussions). It is quite possible that someone already has a link to the channel you need and they just haven't added it to our playlist yet.

But keep in mind that not all TV channels are available for viewing online, and in this case there is little we can do about it.

### Are you planning to include a Video On Demand (VOD) to the playlist?

No.

### Why is the channel on the iptv-org.github.io but not in the playlist?

The site contains a list of all TV channels in the world and only those of them for which we have working stream links are included in the playlists.

### Can I add a radio broadcast?

Yes, if it is a [visual radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_radio) in which a video and audio are shown at the same time.

### Why don't you accept links to Xtream Codes server?

Xtream Codes streams tend to be very unstable, and often links to them fail very quickly, so it's easier for us to initially exclude them from the playlist than to search for expired ones every day.
